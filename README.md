<h1>Film gen</h1>

<h3>The idea</h3>

The idea of this program is that it generates the title and description of a movie by randomly grabbing words from a database.

This idea is based on sakhila_master's database, in which the movie table shows all generated movies instead of actual movies.

<!--<h3>How will it work</h3>

A title is created by choosing random words from a database. That can be just a word, a name of a place, et cetera…

The title consists of a template and the database chooses words from other tables.

“A (hyperbolic) (story) of a (subject) fand a (subject) who must (verb) a (subject) in (location)” -->

<h3>Database</h3>

All generated titles & descriptions are stored in a relational database with foreign keys.
The database is used in SQLite.
